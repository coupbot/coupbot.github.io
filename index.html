							<p style="color: black">Our task was to create and train a bot for the board game Coup. Coup is a game similar to the card game BS, in that bluffing is a huge aspect of the game. Here's a short video on how the game works: <br>
							<br >

							<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xUNWl5fWfEY?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br>

							On each turn each player has to evaluate the potential gain from lying against the likelihood of getting caught in a lie, creating many interesting game states. We believe this is important because if a machine can learn to lie to get the upper hand, one of the most inherently human traits, then machines are that much closer to being able to emulate human thoughts and emotions. [add more]? <br> <br>


Before we did anything, we had to code a complete terminal version of the game from scratch. We elected to do this in python. To find the best bot, we implemented a genetic algorithm. We distilled the flow of the game into a tree pictured below.<br> </p>

<br><br> <p style="color: black">For each possible decision, there existed a probability which was represented as an edgeweight. From there, we would randomly generate edge weights within a certain range. Once we got the bots to work, we simulated a battle royale style arena; We generate a population of 100 initial bots, and then had them train by playing each other 100 times. We then had the bots with the highest winrates afterplay against a designated "baseline bot." The winrates of these bots is represented by the overall fitness score. We then selected the bots that won the most, and “mutated” them — that is, we preserved some of their edge weights, and slightly altered others. The goal of this is to eventually converge on an optimal bot. </text></p>

						<div id="curve_chart" style="width: 1000px; height: 500px"></div>
						<br>

								<p style="color: black;">In our first iteration of our genetic algorithm, we implemented a genetic algorithm with no mutations or crossovers -- in essence, it is a pure selection process that selects the most fit bots and moved them on to the next generation. We mainly wanted to see if our method of testing would could accurately tell which bots from the starting population could consitently win. This was succsessful, and we can see a very clear upward trend in the overall fitness of our bots. The learner was able to successfully converge on a single bot that could win with about 60% of the time. </p>
						<div id="chart2" style="width: 1000px; height: 500px"></div>
						<br>
							<p style="color:black;"> In this iteration, we implemented a full genetic algorthim -- that is, we used crossover, selection and mutation. To increase consistency, we placed bounds on our mutations, so they only ever add plus or minus 5 percent to any one gene. This resulted in a hill climbing algorithm. Bots would gradually change and mutate until they reafched local maximum. We see several instances of overall upward trends, with the most notable being from Generation 200 to Generation 275.  </p>
